We were not able to implement changing the name of preparation methods. As the
name of preparation methods are also used as their primary keys, we couldn't
implement this feature without much modifications to our ER design and SQL
tables.

## Two Interesting Page

### Create Item Page

```
/dashboard/add_item/<uid>
```

The page is used for creating new items. there are multiple select operations
used to get information like markets and fridge compartments, which are used to
popoulate UI elements, and one insert operation used to insert a new item using
user specified information, including market and fridge compartment information.
This page is interesting because it first fetch data and then use that data to
perform an insertion, whereas the most straightforward way might be to just
perform one insertion and don't use a UI element that need data.

### Sharing Page

Sharing page is used to share an item between two users. In order to implement
this, one selection is used to get the original share of the original owner, an
update is used to adjust the share of the original user and an insert is used to
create a new ownership entity for the new owner. This page is intersting because
the desired effect is not performed with just insert or just update, but by
using a mixture of these two.

## Demo

Hosted on [Google Cloud](http://35.185.22.82:8111/)

### Starting the Production Server

1. Make a copy of `start.template.sh` and name it `start.sh`
2. Comment out the first line to enable production server
3. Add username and password to database in `start.sh`
4. Replace the last line with `flask run -p 8111 -h 0.0.0.0`
5. `sh start.sh` and the server will be hosted at the above address

## Development

1. Make a copy of `start.template.sh`, and name it to `start.sh`
2. Add username and password to `start.sh`
3. `sh start.sh` and the frontend will be hosted at:
   [`http://127.0.0.1:5000`](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
